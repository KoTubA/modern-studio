# Hello Roman - Projekt od A do Z

## Project prupose

**Moder Studio** is a project created based on the `"Project from A to Z"` course from the [hello roman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq8XmOMtrUCb8FcFHQEd8_g) channel, resulting from a collaboration with [Modern Studio](https://www.msnieruchomosci.pl/), a company that stands out for its innovative approach to real estate and investment topics.

The repository is divided into separate branches based on the **22** available lessons, which will show you how to create a project for a real company from start to finish. The course includes:

- client consultation
- creating wireframes and designing the website in Figma
- writing copy and selecting images for the site
- implementing the project using the Gatsby framework with Contentful
- automatic deployment of the application (in my case, using Github/Netlify/Contentful)

The `main` branch contains additional features not covered in the course, while the last branch related to the course is called `refactor`.
